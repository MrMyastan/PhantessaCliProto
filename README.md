# PhantessaCliProto
A command-line prototype (to get used to working with Entity Framework, LINQ, and SQLite) of my idea for my first GUI app, Phantessa, an inventory database app for vinyl records. The plan is to make it cross platform as a standalone desktop app with Avalonia.

Yes, I am aware the code is a mess. My C# is a lil rusty, don't @ me.
